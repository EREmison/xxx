(After Millay's Blue Beard)

This door you might not open, so I will;
Enter now and witness what faithlessness
You have bought . . . . Here slips what I thought was dulled,
Is sharp as ever and more dangerous.
Finger bones like cleavers, poisonous skulls
Hang off long hooks like tunics of Nessus.
Husband Heracles, intended Maxwellâ€”
The road to Hell's paved for us. Guess I missed
Receiving what keeps others from killing
What they wished they deserved (but can't). Ruthless
Would be a better name for these dealings
In baths and misguided gifts of meat stuffs.
What mean gods might've made so worst a wife?
What door(s) might shut to replace your best knife?
